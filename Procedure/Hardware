#Procedure
The system started by collecting images that will be used to train the model. 
Then, the images were annotated to make them a complete dataset. The images in the dataset then go through preprocessing. 
The images in the dataset then go through preprocessing. Here the preprocessing processes used were resize and auto contrast. 
The preprocessed data is then used to train the model. The models used here are several types of YOLOv5, YOLOv6, and YOLOv7. 
The preprocessed data is then used to train the model. The models used here are several types of YOLOv5, YOLOv6, and YOLOv7. 

#Hardware
##Look at FIG 2.
The black arrow shows the power connection between items, where the red arrows show both power and data. 
From the image, NUC plays the role of the processor, where the main process is done here. 
This is where the object detection model runs. It is then connected to the arduino and camera. 
The Arduino then sends PWM signals to the motor driver, which in turn controls the motorâ€™s movement based on the received signals. 
The driver then moves the motor based on the signal received
Power source used in the circuit is from the battery, which is connected to the switch and  power indicator.
